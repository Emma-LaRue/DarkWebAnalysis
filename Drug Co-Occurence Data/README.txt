Indy_Co-Occurence_Data uses Indiana overdose deaths to create a dataframe of most common pairs of drugs.
The Indy_opioid-geo.csv includes the drugs found in each person's system when they died.
We look at the most common among these and compare them to the market data we have.
Drug_Co-Occurence_Analysis separates the unique buyers by name.
It then finds the most common drug pairs bought together.
We then compared the two datasets to find any similarities.
